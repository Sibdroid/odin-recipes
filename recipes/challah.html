    <ol>
        <li><b>Dough</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Put bread flour in a bowl. Mix in the ½ cup of sugar and the salt.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl or large measuring cup, add the 
                1 ½ cups of warm water.<br>
                Mix in the 1 tablespoon of sugar. Sprinkle the yeast 
                on top and wait 8 minutes.<br>
                The yeast mixture should be foamy.
            </li>
            <li>Briefly mix the yeast mixture, then mix it into the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix in the eggs and oil.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 cup warm water, and 
                knead the dough for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise, covered, for two-four hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Braiding</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the dough into four parts. These will make 4 challahs.</li>
            <li>Take one part. Separate it into four pieces. Take each piece and 
                roll it between your<br>hands until it is a long strand.
                Attach the four strands together at one end by<br>
                squeezing the ends together.</li>
            <li>Place on a piece of foil or a pan.</li>
            <li>Take the strand at the far left and braid by putting it 
                over two strands to the right<br> and then put it back
                under one strand to the left.
            </li>
            <li>Take the strand at the far right and put it over two strands to the 
                left and then put it back<br>under one strand to the right.</li>
            <li>Repeat the last two steps until you reach the end of the strands.</li>
            <li>Do the same thing with the other three parts.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Finish</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Brush each loaf with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Allow to rise for two hours.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 25 minutes.</li>
