    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <b>baguette</b> is a variety of French bread distinguishable by its much 
        greater length than width, and noted for
    </p>
    <p>
        its very crispy crust. The standard girth size of a baguette is about 
        5 or 6 cm, and it can be up to a meter in length.
    </p>
    <p>
        One loaf typically weighs 250g (8.8 ounces). 
        It may also be referred to as a <em>French loaf</em> or <em>French stick.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Active dry yeast (95–110°F / 35–43°C) - 
            1¼ teaspoons / 0.18 ounces / 5 grams</li>
        <li>Very warm water (105–115°F / 41–46°C) - 1¼ cups / 2 ounces / 59.25 grams</li>
        <li>Unbleached all-purpose floor - 2¼ cups / 18 ounces / 500 grams</li>
        <li>Salt - 2¼ teaspoons / 0.47 ounces / 13.5 grams</li>
        <li>Cool water (75°F / 24°C) - 1¼ cups / 10.5 ounces / 295.25 grams</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Dough</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a fork, stir together the yeast and warm water in a small bowl 
                until the yeast dissolves. Let stand for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix the cool water, yeast mixture and flour gently 
                with your fingers to form a mass.</li>
            <li>On a lightly-floured work surface, knead for 5 minutes. 
                The dough should now be supple and resilient.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a light towel.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest for 25 minutes—this period is 
                called the autolyse.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough for 6–8 minutes. Overkneading could make an 
                overly tough dough; you're looking for a dough that is 
                smooth and stretchy.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>First rise</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly oil a bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat 
                it with oil. Cover the bowl with a tea towel.</li>
            <li>Let rise at room temperature (75–77°F / 24-25°C) for 1½–2 hours 
                (until the volume doubles).</li>
            <li>Gently deflate the dough. Fold it over itself, then 
                reshape into a ball. Cover again with a tea towel.</li>
            <li>Let rise for 1¼ hours or until it doubles again.</li>
            <li>Once again, gently deflate the dough. Reshape into a round 
                and cover, letting it rise for about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Shaping</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 
                3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each).</li>
            <li>Take one piece and gently stretch into a rectangle, 
                leaving some large bubbles in the dough.</li>
            <li>Fold the top third down and the bottom third up.</li>
            <li>
                Form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from left 
                to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough over about a third of the way each time, seal 
                the length of the loaf, then repeat.</li>
            <li>You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the baguette 
                while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. <br>Seal the seam, being careful 
                not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure.</li>
            <li>Set aside on the work surface to relax before elongating it, and repeat the 
                shaping process with remaining pieces of dough.</li>
            <li>Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by 
                rolling it back and forth on the work surface.<br>Begin with both hands over 
                the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the loaf reaches 
                the desired length.<br>Make sure that the loaves don't exceed the length 
                allowed by the oven.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Second rise</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the finished loaves on a peel or upside down baking sheet lined 
                with parchment paper and generously sprinkled with cornmeal or on a 
                baguette pan.</li>
            <li>Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic or a floured cloth and let rise for 
                30 to 40 minutes until the loaves are slightly plump but still not doubled 
                in volume.<br>The final rise is short, because you want the baguettes to be 
                slightly under-proofed; this will give them a better oven spring, resulting 
                in loaves with a light,<br>airy crumb and more flared cuts.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Preparing for baking</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
            <li>
                Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place 
                an empty water pan directly under the stone.</li>
            <li>Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to make 3–5 slashes, depending on the 
                length of your loaves, on the top of each baguette. The cuts should run<br> 
                from one end of the loaf to the other, rather than across it, and the blade 
                should be held at a 30° angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open 
                in the oven.<br>Be careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate 
                the loaves.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Baking</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the baguette mold 
                in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan<br>and quickly 
                close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the loaves and 
                oven walls 6–8 times and close the door. After 2 more minutes,<br>
                spray the loaves and the oven walls again.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400°F and bake for 
                25–30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden brown and crisp. 
                <br>Move them to a rack to cool.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, 
                ripe French cheese and a glass of wine.</li>
